# GooseBot
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **This is a teaching resource.** GooseBot and this repo are meant to introduce concepts of software development, networking, design, and _making cool things_ rather than just using them. The code is not professional level nor production quality. Do not use this Discord bot for anything serious. 

## So you like Discord?!
Well, why don't we build our own bot? It will do whatever we want. How do we get started?

1. We need a place for the bot to live. I will leave that up to you and your parents (hosting can be expensive üòû).
2. We need the software environment. Make sure `git` is installed and type
```
git clone https://github.com/marquis-goose/goosebot.git
```
