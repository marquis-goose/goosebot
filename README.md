# GooseBot
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **This is a teaching resource.** GooseBot and this repo are meant to introduce concepts of software development, networking, design, and _making cool things_ rather than just using them. The code is not professional level nor production quality. Do not use this Discord bot for anything serious. 

## So you like Discord?!
Well, why don't we build our own bot? It will do whatever we want. How do we get started?

1. We need a place for the bot to live. I will leave that up to you and your parents (hosting can be expensive üòû).

(We are trying to keep things easy with the software, but that means the hardware needs to be set up correctly. Using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) means it needs to be installed. There are other options (like we discussed during the lecture)! But, if you want to follow along and have your own [Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) for GooseBot's home, then find a Miniconda version that works for you (maybe `Miniconda3-latest-Linux-armv7l.sh`) from [here](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/). Otherwise, use the `requirements.txt` files found in this repo.)

2. We need the software environment. Make sure `git` is installed and type
```
git clone 
```
